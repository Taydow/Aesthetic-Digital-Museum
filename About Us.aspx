                           (Est. in 2022), is bringing a whole museum filled with divine art to you, it is inspired by art that is made by students who are willing to share their message to the world through art.

                            Aesthetic Digital Museum was founded by Mr Roderick.T Tsosane, born on the 16th of April 2000, raised in a local township called Vosloorus, which is found in South Africa (Gauteng Province), In 2019 the world experienced a pandemic known as COVID-19, that resulted in museums closing and impacting the sales of art as everyone was restricted to enter the premises. He saw an opportunity in the market as businesses were suffering in the presence of this new virus, thus creating a platform that allows individuals, mostly students to still share and explore art without being in contact with one another or the museum. This complements the likes of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, hence the name "Digital".
